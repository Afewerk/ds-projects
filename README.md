- [ Generating African Masks with GANs using Tensorflow on TPUs](https://towardsdatascience.com/african-masks-gans-tpu-9a6b0cf3105c) by Victor Dibia. In August 2018, I had the opportunity to attend the 2018 Deep Learning Indaba where Google generously provided access to TPUs (v2) to all participants! I finally came around to spending some time getting familiar with running ML experiments on TPUs and started out with training a GAN to generate images based on a custom dataset I have been curating — the African masks dataset. TPUs provide some serious compute horsepower (at par with high end GPUs) that enable fast turnaround for training experiments . Having access to a TPU allowed me explore some questions related to training GANs — e.g. how much data is enough data? How might image size affect generated output? How important is data quality (e.g efforts to curate your dataset?) How novel are the generated samples? etc. In this post, I provide a walk through steps in I took training the GAN, results and interesting observations.
