## Unsupervised learning report

- [Math lectures Part 1](https://github.com/ExtraLime/math-lectures) Combine NLP with supervised and unsupervised learning to classify math lectures. By William Morgan.

## Final capstone

- [Cover to Cover: A (not so) Novel Approach to Book Reccommendations](https://www.thinkful.com/project-hunt/projects/cover-to-cover-a-not-so-novel-approach-to-book-reccommendations-4230) by Mark Espina. The saying goes "Don't Judge a book by it's cover" But Why? Anyone who shops at a local bookstore is definitely paying attention to the covers. And from personal experience, it is a key determinant on whether I end up purchasing a book. First, I will discuss the pros and cons of applying Convolutional Neural Nets to Image Classification, attempting to predict genre labels. In the second half, I will be exploring the application of feature extraction with similarity models as the basis for an Image Content-based retrieval system, Cover-to-Cover.

- [Using machine learning to cluster and classify math lectures](https://github.com/ExtraLime/math-lectures) by Will Morgan. Using machine learning to cluster and classify math lectures.

- [Capstone_2016_us_elections](https://github.com/ebadran/thinkfulBC/blob/master/final_capstone/Capstone_2016_us_elections.ipynb) by Emile Badran. In this capstone project, I process tweets from the leading Democratic (Hillary Clinton) and Republican (Donald Trump) candidates and key 2016 US election hashtags. I apply Natural Language Processing and Network Analysis techniques to find the key topics, and the most influential actors that have guided the public debate.
